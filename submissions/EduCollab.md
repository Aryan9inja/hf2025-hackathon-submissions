## Project Title
EduCollab

## Project Description
EduCollab is a collaborative classroom workspace that lets teachers spin up virtual classrooms, invite learners, and share study material in seconds. Built on the Next.js App Router, it gives authenticated members real-time access to class resources, granular note permissions, and a guided onboarding flow that captures usernames the moment a student signs up.

## Inspiration behind the Project
After spending the last semester juggling Discord threads, Drive folders, and scattered PDFs, I wanted a single hub that felt purpose-built for classrooms. EduCollab aims to give remote and hybrid groups a lightweight space where sharing notes, managing membership, and controlling access are all handled in one streamlined interface.

## Tech Stack
Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Zustand for client state, React Hook Form + Zod for guarded forms, Sonner for feedback toasts, and Appwrite (Auth, Tables/Databases, Storage) powering identity, classroom data, and file uploads. While whole this is deployed on appwrite sites.
